Working Files List
------------------

Copyright © 2016 Anthony Fung

Thanks for installing this extension. Working Files List is a Visual Studio
extension tool window that shows a selectable list of files that are open in
the editor. For the latest information, see
https://github.com/Ant-f/WorkingFilesList

To get started, select [View] -> [Other Windows] -> [Working Files List] on the
Visual Studio menu bar.

The main area of the tool window displays a list of every file that is open for
editing; the name of the active window is displayed in bold text.

  * Left-clicking on an item in the list activates the tab for that file

  * Middle-clicking on an item closes that file

  * Hover the mouse over an item to show its full name in the tool tip

The controls at the top of the window allow sorting and grouping. From left to
right:

  (1) Project Name Sort: applied sort for each file’s containing project

  (2) File Name Sort: applied sort for each file

  (3) Group by Project: groups each list entry by its containing project

  (4) Show Recent Usage: shows the order of usage of each list item as a bar
      chart.

  (5) Assign Project Colours: gives each list item a background colour, which
      is linked with the item’s associated project.

  (6) File Name Segments: represents how many parts of the full file name is
      displayed. By default, only the name for each open file is shown. By
      increasing this number, it is possible to include the directories that
      the file is in.

  (7) Extension Information: further details about this extension, including
      its license.
